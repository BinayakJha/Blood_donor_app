The project's goal is to make blood donation easier for Nepalese people. It will establish a direct link between blood donors and those in need of blood. When people keep their blood requests, it notifies people who have the same blood group or a matching blood group, and can if the donor accepts the request the requested man will get the contact number, and then they can donate the blood. This will address a major problem with blood donation in Nepal. It will slowly be available worldwide.

## **Challenges we ran into**

We ran into many bugs like sometimes the forms were not working which were easily solved in some minutes and also we had to make the whole platform a clean UI so it took us 1 day just to think about the UI and make it.
